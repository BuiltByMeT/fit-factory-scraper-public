also need to figure out how to do all this again since I haven't done it since Aug 18/19 2014 (ls -l)

-in browser navigate to url `localhost`

-navigate to current files in terminal `$ cd ../../var/www/html`

## ACTUALLY instead do this to run straight from working directory

-navigate to directory & run
```
python3 -m http.server
```
-navigate to url returned

-will work until the command is killed
